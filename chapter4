* Chapter 4: Native Android Development

** Android Architecture

The SalesforceSDK is provided as a JAR file.
The JAR file only contains the java classes. 
To build an application that makes use of the SDK, you not only need the JAR file, but also a number of other libaries/resource files.
These files are in the native/SalesforceSDK directory.
Sample applications have links to the subset of those files they require (or just copies on the Windows platform).
The easiest way to get started is to clone one of a sample application.
In this section, we take a look at the code and various resource and asset files that are in the native/SalesforceSDK directory.

*** A look at the SalesforceSDK source tree

The SalesforceSDK source code lives in the native/SalesforceSDK project.
