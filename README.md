# Salesforce Mobile SDK for Android

This SDK consists of components to support development of two main kinds of apps: native Android apps and hybrid apps.

- The native folder contains the main native SalesforceSDK libraries, test apps, and native sample apps. You will need to use the native jar files in order to run the hybrid sample apps.
- The hybrid folder contains sample apps that use the Salesforce SDK in hybrid mode:
that is, some native code and some html5+javascript.
